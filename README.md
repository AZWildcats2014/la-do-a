Website for a Restaurant (First draft)
I started parts of the Stylesheet with a different website currently online at www.la-dona.com.  This is my first draft and completed it
on 1/30/2020.  I am in the process of creating a new website with a more clean Stylesheet and sleeker look to this one. 

What I learned:
    -  Learned how to keep a stylesheet in order to create a more responsive website depending on resolution
    -  Learned how to inline style CSS when needed, knowing that an external sheet is more useful given mobile first design
    -  Learned simple JavaScript for the creation of the Carousel to show the pictures of the food.
    -  Learned how to create a table and table data formatting
    -  Recognized how CSS, HTML, and JavaScript worked together to create a static webpage
    -  Learned how Media Queries can be used to format the webpage to various devices/resolutions
    -  Learned how to scope out and format objects in a webpage.
    
What I can work on:
    -  I can improve the readability of my code, especially my CSS
    -  Work on improving the look and feel of the website, its too rigid and bland
    -  Improve on my JavaScript to have the NavBar follow you on scroll in Mobile, also include back to top button
    -  Create less redundant classes (row, column, single, double, etc)
    -  Learn Bootstrap, Angular, and React
